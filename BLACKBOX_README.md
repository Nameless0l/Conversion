# Integer Conversion

This code converts an integer from one base to another.

## Usage

To use this code, you will need to provide the following information:

* The base of the input number
* The base of the output number
* The input number

The code will then convert the input number to the output base and print the result to the console.

## Example

The following example shows how to convert the number 1234 from base 10 to base 2.

```
./integer_conversion 10 2 1234
```

The output of this command will be:

```
10111101010
```

## Code Explanation

The code for this program is divided into two parts:

* The main function
* The parse function

The main function is responsible for getting the input from the user and calling the parse function to convert the number. The parse function is responsible for actually converting the number from one base to another.

The parse function works by first converting the input number to an array of digits. The digits are then converted to their corresponding values in the output base. The final step is to convert the array of digits back to a number.

## Conclusion

This code is a simple example of how to convert an integer from one base to another. The code is easy to understand and can be used for a variety of purposes.
